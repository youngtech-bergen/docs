# Agenda for Meeting 15.01.2020

## Kickoff

Hans Kristian Flaatten is available on the _18th of February_ with _Open Source_ as the topic of the talk. We need to agree on some details before we can pin down the details:

* How many do we expect to meet up?
* Where do we want to host the event (auditorie, åpen sone m/ skjerm)?
* Should we publish to an exisiting platform (Meetup)?

When we've decided on this, we can double down and start making invites, creating events, etc.

## Funding

As of now, Roger Antonesen is no longer "plassjef" at DNB, and there's no immediate plans of finding a replacement in the near future. We should contact "Storbyrådet" here @ DNB for more near-term funding, otherwise we should resort to sponsorships and membership fees to be as independent as possible.

## Vision

We should write down a descriptive statement on what we want to do, how we want to do it, and what we're doing to make it happen. Should be tweet-length.

## General

We've created a Facebook page @youngtech.bergen, and should start copping usernames for other relevant platforms. We should decide where we want to be visible, and what type of message we want to spread. Do we want to post articles, events only? Relevant memes, "lighter" content?

__Arne:__ I'd love to have a Medium publication.
