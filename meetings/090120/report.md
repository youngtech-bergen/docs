## Kickoff

The current plan is to arrange a kickoff in mid-late February 2020 with speaker Hans Kristian Flaatten. More details will be decided at a later point.

**Comments:**

> _**Arne**: On the topic side of things, I'd actually like to have some talk about open-source, contribution and crossing (company) borders -- which is in the spirit of what we're trying to achieve with the initiative. I know Hans Kristian is an engaged open source contributor, and think this could be a good topic, although it will have to be a more defined one._
