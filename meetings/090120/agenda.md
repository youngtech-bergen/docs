# Meeting 09.01.2020

## Agenda

### Kickoff

We previously planned to arrange a kickoff by the end of this January. This currently looks a little too tight, so we will need to discuss a new date, and set our goals and responsibilites accordingly. We've talked to [Hans Kristian Flaatten](https://github.com/Starefossen) who is willing to hold a talk at the kickoff. We will have to discuss the new date with him, and settle on a topic.

> _**Arne**: On the topic side of things, I'd actually like to have some talk about open-source, contribution and crossing (company) borders -- which is in the spirit of what we're trying to achieve with the initiative. I know Hans Kristian is an engaged open source contributor, and think this could be a good topic, although it will have to be a more defined one._

### Responsibilites

In order to be efficient in planning and arranging the kickoff, we need to distribute responsibilites among us. These will be temporary, as we want to set up a board with defined roles at a later stage, if this initiative catches wind. We will have to cover these areas of responsibility:

- Invitations
- Booking/facilites -- premises, food, drinks etc.
- Program
- Experience -- stickers, "swag", etc. cost?
- Definition of purpose and goals
- [Basic website](https://github.com/youngtech-bergen/web), domain(?)
- Secretary -- write a summary of this meeting
- Funding -- involve SigbjÃ¸rn Hovland or other relevant people

> _**Arne**: To clarify the "experience" part -- we want the people attending to remember the initiative and keep it in mind until an eventual next event, and as developers, stickers are a great and inexpensive way of achieving that. I've created a basic website with no content -- logo/branding is *not* final, this is just something I threw together._

### Program

Some questions about the program:

- Duration?
- What type of content do we want to present?
- When do we plug ourselves and how do we portray the initiative?

### Feilefest announcement

There's an event hosted by various tech-companies in Solheimsviken on the 16th of January. Stine Grindheim has asked us to announce YoungTech at the event, which can get us some traction and get the word out there.

> _**Arne**: I'm attending and willing to say a few words at the event -- if anyone wants to join me, please do!_

## Notes

> **Arne**: I'm hoping that we can establish as much as possible under this meeting. I'd also like to propose that we keep all documentation in [Git](https://github.com/youngtech-bergen/docs), as we're aiming to be a community of developers/technologists
