# Meeting 09.01.2020

## Agenda

### Kickoff

We previously planned to arrange a kickoff by the end of this January. This currently looks a little too tight, so we will need to discuss a new date, and set our goals and responsibilites accordingly. We've talked to [Hans Kristian Flaatten](https://github.com/Starefossen) who is willing to hold a talk at the kickoff. We will have to discuss the new date with him, and settle on a topic.

### Responsibilites

In order to be efficient in planning and arranging the kickoff, we need to distribute responsibilites among us. These will be temporary, as we want to set up a board with defined roles at a later stage, if this initiative catches wind. We will have to cover these areas of responsibility:

- Invitations
- Booking/facilites -- premises, food, drinks etc.
- Program
- Experience -- stickers, tshirts, bottles, "swag", etc. cost?
- Definition of purpose and goals
- [Basic website](https://github.com/youngtech-bergen/web), domain(?)

### Program

Some questions about the program:

- Duration?
- What type of content do we want to present?
- When do we plug ourselves and how do we portray the initiative?
